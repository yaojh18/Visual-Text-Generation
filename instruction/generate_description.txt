You are an intelligent figure description generator. I will provide you with a caption and related context for a figure taken from scientific paper. Your task is to generate the general layout description of a possible figure that matches the given caption and related context. Since this is a really difficult job, I will also provide you with the original figure as cheating reference. But I wish you can figure out some other layout description yourself. You description should be brief and contain necessary object and text description. Please refer to the example below for the desired format.

Caption: Figure 1: The self-consistency method contains three steps: (1) prompt a language model using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting; (2) replace the “greedy decode” in CoT prompting by sampling from the language model’s decoder to generate a diverse set of reasoning paths; and (3) marginalize out the reasoning paths and aggregate by choosing the most consistent answer in the final answer set.
Related context: A salient aspect of humanity is that people think differently. It is natural to suppose that in tasks requiring deliberate thinking, there are likely several ways to attack the problem. We propose that such a process can be simulated in language models via sampling from the language model’s decoder. For instance, as shown in Figure 1, a model can generate several plausible responses to a math question that all arrive at the same correct answer (Outputs 1 and 3). Since language models are not perfect reasoners, the model might also produce an incorrect reasoning path or make a mistake in one of the reasoning steps (e.g., in Output 2), but such solutions are less likely to arrive at the same answer. That is, we hypothesize that correct reasoning processes, even if they are diverse, tend to have greater agreement in their final answer than incorrect processes.
Layout: The figure is a vertical flowchart with three main compartments, each detailing one of the three steps of the self-consistency method. The compartments are sequentially numbered and titled to facilitate understanding. The left compartment is "CoT Prompting", which contains 3 visual elements. (1) A textbox labeled "Initial Question" presents a complex problem, such as "If a farmer has 5 apples and gives away 2, how many does she have left?". (2) An arrow points from this box to the language model, which is labeled "CoT Prompt.". (3) A speech bubble emerges from the language model illustrating the CoT process: "The farmer starts with 5 apples. After giving 2 away, she has 5 - 2 = 3 apples remaining.". The middle compartment is "Sampling Diverse Reasoning Paths:, which contains 2 visual elements. (1) From the language model, multiple arrows branch out, each leading to a different reasoning path outcome. For instance, different paths may involve varying arithmetic errors or considerations, such as "She gave away 2 out of 5, so 5 - 2 equals 3," or "She might have bought more, but with the information given, 5 - 2 equals 3." (2) Each path terminates in a box that contains a potential answer, highlighting the variability of the reasoning process. The right compartment is "Aggregating Consistent Answers", which contains 3 visual elements. (1) The multiple answer boxes from step 2 feed into a funnel-like shape, indicating the process of marginalization and aggregation. (2) A mechanism or icon representing decision-making is placed where the paths converge, filtering the answers into a single outcome. (3) The final answer is then displayed in a prominent box that reads "Consensus Answer: The farmer has 3 apples left."

Caption: Figure 2. Overview of AdaFocus. It first takes a quick glance at each frame vt using a light-weighted global CNN fG. Then a recurrent policy network ? is built on top of fG to select the most important image region v?t in terms of recognition. A high-capacity local CNN fL is adopted to extract features from v?t. Finally, a recurrent classifier aggregates the features across frames to obtain the prediction pt.
Related context: Overview. We first give an overview of AdaFocus (Figure 2). Consider the online video recognition scenario, where a stream of frames come in sequentially while a prediction may be retrieved after processing any number of frames. At each time step, AdaFocus first takes a quick glance at the full frame with a light-weighted CNN fG , obtaining cheap and coarse global features. Then the features are fed into a recurrent policy network ? to aggregate the information across frames and accordingly determine the location of an image patch to be focused on, under the goal of maximizing its contribution to video recognition. A high capacity local CNN fL is then adopted to process the selected patch for more accurate but computationally expensive representations. Finally, a classifier fC integrates the features of all previous frames to produce a prediction.
