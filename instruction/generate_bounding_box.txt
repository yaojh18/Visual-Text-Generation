You are an intelligent bounding box generator. I will provide you with a caption and general layout description of a figure taken from scientific paper. Your task is to generate the bounding boxes for the objects, arrows and texts in the figure, along with a background prompt describing the scene. The figure is of size 512x512. The top-left corner has coordinate [0, 0]. The bottom-right corner has coordinate [512, 512]. The bounding boxes should not go beyond the image boundaries. Each bounding box should be in the format of (type (object, arrow, text), description prompt, [top-left x coordinate, top-left y coordinate, box width, box height]) and include exactly one object (i.e., start the object name with "a" or "an" if possible). Do not put objects that are already provided in the bounding boxes into the background prompt. Do not include non-existing or excluded objects in the background prompt. If needed, you can make reasonable guesses. Please refer to the example below for the desired format.

Caption: Figure 1: The self-consistency method contains three steps: (1) prompt a language model using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting; (2) replace the “greedy decode” in CoT prompting by sampling from the language model’s decoder to generate a diverse set of reasoning paths; and (3) marginalize out the reasoning paths and aggregate by choosing the most consistent answer in the final answer set.
Layout Description: The figure is a vertical flowchart with three main compartments, each detailing one of the three steps of the self-consistency method. The compartments are sequentially numbered and titled to facilitate understanding. The left compartment is "CoT Prompting", which contains 3 visual elements. (1) A textbox labeled "Initial Question" presents a complex problem, such as "If a farmer has 5 apples and gives away 2, how many does she have left?". (2) An arrow points from this box to the language model, which is labeled "CoT Prompt.". (3) A speech bubble emerges from the language model illustrating the CoT process: "The farmer starts with 5 apples. After giving 2 away, she has 5 - 2 = 3 apples remaining.". The middle compartment is "Sampling Diverse Reasoning Paths:, which contains 2 visual elements. (1) From the language model, multiple arrows branch out, each leading to a different reasoning path outcome. For instance, different paths may involve varying arithmetic errors or considerations, such as "She gave away 2 out of 5, so 5 - 2 equals 3," or "She might have bought more, but with the information given, 5 - 2 equals 3." (2) Each path terminates in a box that contains a potential answer, highlighting the variability of the reasoning process. The right compartment is "Aggregating Consistent Answers", which contains 3 visual elements. (1) The multiple answer boxes from step 2 feed into a funnel-like shape, indicating the process of marginalization and aggregation. (2) A mechanism or icon representing decision-making is placed where the paths converge, filtering the answers into a single outcome. (3) The final answer is then displayed in a prominent box that reads "Consensus Answer: The farmer has 3 apples left."
